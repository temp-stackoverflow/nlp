I/PRP sympathize/VBP with/IN @david-t-macknet/USR about/IN what/WP the/DT data/NN is/VBZ about/IN ,/, but/CC in/IN large/JJ tables/NNS ,/, sorting/VBG your/PRP$ physical/JJ data/NNS by/IN a/DT natural/JJ key/NN could/MD end/VB up/RP taking/VBG a/DT long/JJ time/NN in/IN tables/NNS with/IN millions/NNS of/IN rows/NNS ./.
A/DT PK/NN on/IN a/DT surrogate/JJ identity/NN always/RB sorts/NNS to/TO the/DT end/NN ./.

Developers/NNS can/MD get/VB away/RB with/IN this/DT working/NN in/IN a/DT development/NN environment/NN where/WRB they/PRP are/VBP only/RB returning/VBG a/DT few/JJ rows/NNS of/IN data/NNS and/CC the/DT sub/NN tables/NNS usually/RB only/RB have/VBP a/DT small/JJ amount/NN of/IN data/NNS ,/, but/CC in/IN a/DT production/NN environment/NN ,/, this/DT kind/NN of/IN query/NN can/MD become/VB exponentially/RB costly/JJ as/IN more/JJR data/NNS is/VBZ added/VBN to/TO the/DT tables/NNS ./.
A/DT better/JJR (/-LRB- not/RB necessarily/RB perfect/JJ )/-RRB- example/NN would/MD be/VB something/NN like/IN :/.

This/DT allows/VBZ database/NN optimizers/NNS to/TO shuffle/VB the/DT data/NNS together/RB ,/, rather/RB than/IN requery/VB on/IN each/DT record/NN from/IN the/DT main/JJ table/NN and/CC I/PRP usually/RB find/VBP when/WRB I/PRP have/VBP to/TO fix/VB code/NN where/WRB this/DT problem/NN has/VBZ been/VBN created/VBN ,/, I/PRP usually/RB end/VBP up/RP increasing/VBG the/DT speed/NN of/IN queries/NNS by/IN 100/CD %/SYM or/CC more/JJR while/IN simultaneously/RB reducing/VBG CPU/NN and/CC memory/NN usage/NN ./.

Assumptions/NNS about/IN the/DT attack/NN scenario/NN If/IN an/DT attacker/NN is/VBZ targeting/VBG variable/JJ usernames/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ username/JJ throttling/NN does/VBZ n't/RB fire/VB ./.
If/IN the/DT attacker/NN is/VBZ using/VBG a/DT botnet/NN or/CC has/VBZ access/NN to/TO a/DT large/JJ IP/NNP range/NN ,/, our/PRP$ IP/NNP throttling/NN is/VBZ powerless/JJ ./.
If/IN the/DT attacker/NN has/VBZ pre-scraped/VBN our/PRP$ userlist/NN (/-LRB- usually/RB possible/JJ on/IN open-registration/NN web/NN services/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, we/PRP ca/MD n't/RB detect/VB an/DT ongoing/JJ attack/NN based/VBN on/IN number/NN of/IN '/`` user/NN not/RB found/VBN '/POS errors/NNS ./.
And/CC if/IN we/PRP enforce/VBP a/DT restrictive/JJ system-wide/NN (/-LRB- all/DT usernames/NNS ,/, all/DT IPs/NNS )/-RRB- throttling/NN ,/, any/DT such/JJ attack/NN will/MD DoS/NN our/PRP$ entire/JJ site/NN for/IN the/DT duration/NN of/IN the/DT attack/NN plus/CC the/DT throttling/NN period/NN ./.
So/RB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB something/NN else/RB ./.
The/DT first/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT countermeasure/NN :/: Whitelisting/NN
What/WP we/PRP can/MD be/VB fairly/RB sure/JJ of/IN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT attacker/NN is/VBZ not/RB able/JJ to/TO detect/VB and/CC dynamically/RB spoof/VBP the/DT IP/NNP addresses/NNS of/IN several/JJ thousand/CD of/IN our/PRP$ users/NNS (/-LRB- +/SYM )/-RRB- ./.
Which/WDT makes/VBZ whitelisting/NN feasible/JJ ./.
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS :/: for/IN each/DT user/NN ,/, we/PRP store/VBP a/DT list/NN of/IN the/DT (/-LRB- hashed/VBN )/-RRB- IPs/NNS from/IN where/WRB the/DT user/NN has/VBZ previously/RB (/-LRB- recently/RB )/-RRB- logged/VBN in/IN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, our/PRP$ whitelisting/NN scheme/NN will/MD function/VB as/IN a/DT locked/VBN '/`` front/JJ door/NN '/'' ,/, where/WRB a/DT user/NN must/MD be/VB connected/VBN from/IN one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ recognized/VBN '/`` good/JJ '/'' IPs/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO log/VB in/RP at/IN all/DT ./.
A/DT brute-force/JJ attack/NN on/IN this/DT '/`` front/JJ door/NN '/'' would/MD be/VB practically/RB impossible/JJ (/-LRB- +/SYM )/-RRB- ./.
(/-LRB- +/SYM )/-RRB- unless/IN the/DT attacker/NN '/`` owns/VBZ '/'' either/CC the/DT server/NN ,/, all/DT our/PRP$ users/NNS '/POS boxes/NNS ,/, or/CC the/DT connection/NN itself/PRP --/-- and/CC in/IN those/DT cases/NNS ,/, we/PRP no/RB longer/RB have/VB an/DT '/`` authentication/NN '/'' issue/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP a/DT genuine/JJ franchise-sized/JJ pull-the-plug/JJ FUBAR/C situation/NN
The/DT second/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT countermeasure/NN :/: System-wide/JJ throttling/NN of/IN unrecognized/JJ IPs/NNS
In/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT whitelist/NN work/VB for/IN an/DT open-registration/JJ web/NN service/NN ,/, where/WRB users/NNS switch/VBP computers/NNS frequently/RB and/CC //CC or/CC connect/VB from/IN dynamic/JJ IP/NNP addresses/NNS ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO keep/VB a/DT '/`` cat/NN door/NN '/'' open/JJ for/IN users/NNS connecting/VBG from/IN unrecognized/JJ IPs/NNS ./.
The/DT trick/NN is/VBZ to/TO design/VB that/DT door/NN so/IN botnets/NNS get/VBP stuck/VBN ,/, and/CC so/RB legitimate/JJ users/NNS get/VBP bothered/VBN as/RB little/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ./.
In/IN my/PRP$ scheme/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ achieved/VBN by/IN setting/VBG a/DT very/RB restrictive/JJ maximum/NN number/NN of/IN failed/JJ login/NN attempts/NNS by/IN unapproved/JJ IPs/NNS over/IN ,/, say/VB ,/, a/DT 3-hour/JJ period/NN (/-LRB- it/PRP may/MD be/VB wiser/JJR to/TO use/VB a/DT shorter/JJR or/CC longer/JJR period/NN depending/VBG on/IN type/NN of/IN service/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC making/VBG that/DT restriction/NN global/JJ ,/, ie./FW for/IN all/DT user/NN accounts/NNS ./.
Even/RB a/DT slow/JJ (/-LRB- 1-2/CD minutes/NNS between/IN attempts/NNS )/-RRB- brute/JJ force/NN would/MD be/VB detected/VBN and/CC thwarted/VBN quickly/RB and/CC effectively/RB using/VBG this/DT method/NN ./.
Of/IN course/NN ,/, a/DT really/RB slow/JJ brute/JJ force/NN could/MD still/RB remain/VB unnoticed/JJ ,/, but/CC too/RB slow/JJ speeds/NNS defeat/VBP the/DT very/JJ purpose/NN of/IN the/DT brute/JJ force/NN attack/NN ./.
What/WP I/PRP am/VBP hoping/VBG to/TO accomplish/VB with/IN this/DT throttling/VBG mechanism/NN is/VBZ that/IN if/IN the/DT maximum/JJ limit/NN is/VBZ reached/VBN ,/, our/PRP$ '/`` cat/NN door/NN '/'' slams/NNS closed/VBD for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, but/CC our/PRP$ front/JJ door/NN remains/VBZ open/JJ to/TO legitimate/JJ users/NNS connecting/VBG by/IN usual/JJ means/NNS :/.
Either/RB by/IN connecting/VBG from/IN one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ recognized/VBN IPs/NNS Or/CC by/IN using/VBG a/DT persistent/JJ login/NN cookie/NN (/-LRB- from/IN anywhere/RB )/-RRB-
The/DT only/JJ legitimate/JJ users/NNS who/WP would/MD be/VB affected/VBN during/IN an/DT attack/NN -/-- ie./FW while/IN the/DT throttling/NN was/VBD activated/VBN -/-- would/MD be/VB users/NNS without/IN persistent/JJ login/NN cookies/NNS who/WP were/VBD logging/VBG in/RP from/IN an/DT unknown/JJ location/NN or/CC with/IN a/DT dynamic/JJ IP/NNP ./.
Those/DT users/NNS would/MD be/VB unable/JJ to/TO login/VB until/IN the/DT throttling/VBG wore/VBD off/RP (/-LRB- which/WDT could/MD potentially/RB take/VB a/DT while/NN ,/, if/IN the/DT attacker/NN kept/VBD his/PRP$ botnet/NN running/VBG despite/IN the/DT throttling/VBG )/-RRB- ./.
To/TO allow/VB this/DT small/JJ subset/NN of/IN users/NNS to/TO squeeze/VB through/IN the/DT otherwise-sealed/JJ cat/NN door/NN ,/, even/RB while/IN bots/NNS were/VBD still/RB hammering/VBG away/RB at/IN it/PRP ,/, I/PRP would/MD employ/VB a/DT '/`` backup/JJ '/'' login/NN form/NN with/IN a/DT CAPTCHA/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT only/JJ way/NN to/TO protect/VB against/IN SQL/NNP injection/NN is/VBZ to/TO remember/VB to/TO use/VB a/DT special/JJ method/NN or/CC function/NN that/WDT does/VBZ The/DT Right/RB Thing/NN every/DT time/NN you/PRP talk/VBP to/TO the/DT database/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG it/PRP wrong/JJ ./.
That/DT way/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN time/NN until/IN you/PRP forget/VBP to/TO correctly/RB format/NN your/PRP$ query/NN at/IN some/DT point/NN in/IN your/PRP$ code/NN ./.
Adopting/VBG the/DT MVC/NN pattern/NN and/CC a/DT framework/NN like/IN CakePHP/NNP or/CC CodeIgniter/NNP is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT right/JJ way/NN to/TO go/VB :/: Common/JJ tasks/NNS like/IN creating/VBG secure/JJ database/NN queries/NNS have/VBP been/VBN solved/VBN and/CC centrally/RB implemented/VBN in/IN such/JJ frameworks/NNS ./.

@martinstoeckli/USR :/: I/PRP have/VBP updated/VBN the/DT answer/NN to/TO cover/VB the/DT current/JJ question/NN ./.
Updated/JJ answer/NN
The/DT question/NN was/VBD edited/VBN (/-LRB- after/IN my/PRP$ answer/NN was/VBD posted/VBN )/-RRB- to/TO specifically/RB target/VB mysqli_escape_string/C ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT alias/NN of/IN mysql_real_escape_string/C and/CC therefore/RB takes/VBZ the/DT connection/NN encoding/VBG into/IN account/NN ./.
This/DT makes/VBZ the/DT original/JJ answer/NN non-applicable/JJ anymore/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP 've/VBP left/VBN it/PRP for/IN completeness/NN ./.
The/DT new/JJ answer/NN ,/, in/IN short/JJ :/: mysqli_escape_string/C is/VBZ as/IN good/JJ security-wise/NN as/IN parameterized/JJ queries/NNS ,/, provided/VBN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB shoot/VB yourself/PRP in/IN the/DT foot/NN ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, what/WP you/PRP must/MD not/RB do/VB is/VBZ highlighted/VBN in/IN the/DT giant/JJ warning/NN on/IN the/DT PHP/NNP doc/NN page/NN :/.
he/DT character/NN set/NN must/MD be/VB set/VBN either/CC at/IN the/DT server/NN level/NN ,/, or/CC with/IN the/DT API/NN function/NN mysqli_set_charset/C (/C )/C for/IN it/PRP to/TO affect/VB mysqli_real_escape_string/C (/C )/C ./.
If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB heed/VB this/DT warning/NN (/-LRB- i.e./FW if/IN you/PRP change/VBP the/DT character/NN set/VBN with/IN a/DT direct/JJ SET/C NAMES/C query/NN )/-RRB- and/CC you/PRP change/VBP the/DT character/NN set/VBN from/IN a/DT single-byte/JJ encoding/NN to/TO a/DT "/`` convenient/JJ "/'' (/-LRB- from/IN the/DT attacker/NN 's/POS perspective/NN )/-RRB- multibyte/JJ encoding/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD have/VB in/IN effect/NN emulated/VBD what/WP the/DT dumb/JJ mysql_escape_string/C does/VBZ :/: attempt/VB to/TO escape/VB characters/NNS without/IN knowing/VBG which/WDT encoding/VBG the/DT input/NN is/VBZ in/IN ./.
This/DT situation/NN leaves/VBZ you/PRP potentially/RB vulnerable/JJ to/TO SQL/NNP injection/NN as/IN described/VBN by/IN the/DT original/JJ answer/NN below/IN ./.
Important/JJ note/NN :/: I/PRP remember/VBP reading/VBG somewhere/RB that/IN recent/JJ MySql/NNP versions/NNS have/VBP plugged/VBN this/DT hole/NN on/IN their/PRP$ end/NN (/-LRB- in/IN the/DT client/NN libraries/NNS ?/. )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ that/IN you/PRP might/MD be/VB perfectly/RB safe/JJ even/RB if/IN using/VBG SET/C NAMES/C to/TO switch/VB to/TO a/DT vulnerable/JJ multibyte/JJ encoding/NN ./.
But/CC please/VB do/VBP n't/RB take/VB my/PRP$ word/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.
Original/JJ answer/NN
In/IN contrast/NN to/TO mysql_real_escape_string/C ,/, the/DT bare/JJ mysql_escape_string/C does/VBZ not/RB take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT connection/NN encoding/NN ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN it/PRP assumes/VBZ the/DT input/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT single-byte/JJ encoding/NN ,/, when/WRB in/IN fact/NN it/PRP can/MD legitimately/RB be/VB in/IN a/DT multibyte/JJ encoding/NN ./.
Some/DT multibyte/JJ encodings/NNS have/VBP byte/NN sequences/NNS that/WDT correspond/VBP to/TO a/DT single/JJ character/NN where/WRB one/CD of/IN the/DT bytes/NNS is/VBZ the/DT ASCII/NNP value/NN of/IN the/DT single/JJ quote/NN (/-LRB- 0x27/CD )/-RRB- ;/: if/IN fed/VBN such/PDT a/DT string/NN ,/, mysql_escape_string/C will/MD happily/RB "/`` escape/VB the/DT quote/NN "/'' ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ substituting/VBG 0x27/CD with/IN 0x5c/CD 0x27/CD ./.
Depending/VBG on/IN the/DT encoding/NN rules/NNS ,/, this/DT could/MD result/VB in/IN mutating/VBG the/DT multibyte/JJ character/NN into/IN another/DT that/WDT includes/VBZ the/DT 0x5c/CD and/CC leaving/VBG the/DT "/`` remaining/JJ "/'' 0x27/CD as/IN a/DT stand-alone/JJ single/JJ quote/NN in/IN the/DT input/NN ./.
Voilà/FW ,/, you/PRP have/VBP injected/VBN an/DT unescaped/JJ quote/NN into/IN the/DT SQL/NNP ./.
For/IN more/JJR details/NNS see/VBP this/DT blog/NN post/NN ./.
@Asad/USR :/: You/PRP specifically/RB did/VBD not/RB ask/VB for/IN something/NN like/IN that/DT ,/, so/IN I/PRP guess/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ your/PRP$ fault/NN :)/UH
@Asad/USR :/: Sure/UH ,/, just/RB joking/VBG :)/UH
In/IN PHP/NNP ,/, you/PRP can/MD use/VB the/DT mcrypt/NN or/CC bcrypt/NN libraries/NNS for/IN better/JJR encryption/NN than/IN md5/NNP or/CC sha1/NNP ./.
If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP stuck/VBN with/IN md5/NNP or/CC sha1/NNP you/PRP should/MD to/TO '/`` stretching/VBG '/'' ,/, where/WRB you/PRP hash/VBP the/DT password/NN 1000/CD 's/POS of/IN times/NNS before/IN you/PRP arrive/VBP at/IN whatever/WDT is/VBZ stored/VBN in/IN the/DT database/NN ./.

The/DT best/JJS policy/NN here/RB is/VBZ to/TO use/VB a/DT prebuilt/NN system/NN designed/VBN by/IN those/DT experts/NNS ,/, and/CC modify/VB it/PRP to/TO meet/VB your/PRP$ needs/NNS ./.
I/PRP was/VBD the/DT downvoter/NN ,/, I/PRP misread/VBD it/PRP though/IN so/IN I/PRP removed/VBD my/PRP$ downvote/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN if/IN they/PRP user/NN has/VBZ access/NN to/TO the/DT database/NN storing/VBG the/DT password/NN (/-LRB- as/IN you/PRP seem/VBP to/TO assume/VB )/-RRB- ,/, the/DT salt/NN is/VBZ probably/RB known/VBN (/-LRB- they/PRP are/VBP typically/RB stored/VBN in/IN plaintext/NN alongside/IN the/DT hashed/VBN password/NN )/-RRB- ./.
If/IN they/PRP are/VBP attacking/VBG it/PRP from/IN the/DT front-end/NN ,/, bruteforce/NN or/CC dictionary/NN attacks/NNS will/MD not/RB be/VB affected/VBN by/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN the/DT salt/NN (/-LRB- unless/IN the/DT salt/NN is/VBZ computationally/RB expensive/JJ )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT goal/NN on/IN the/DT front/JJ end/NN should/MD be/VB delay/VB and/or/CC prevent/VB blind/JJ guessing/VBG ,/, and/CC the/DT backend/NN to/TO salt/NN securely/RB ./.

We/PRP re-ordered/VBD the/DT operations/NNS ,/, first/RB creating/VBG and/CC setting/VBG X/C to/TO its/PRP$ right/JJ value/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT C++/NNP compiler/NN wo/MD n't/RB back/VB up/RP the/DT guarantee/NN (/-LRB- in/IN my/PRP$ code/NN ,/, I/PRP offer/VBP the/DT guarantee/NN as/IN a/DT @warning/C doxygen/C tag/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ kinda/FW sad/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP should/MD not/RB stop/VB you/PRP from/IN trying/VBG to/TO write/VB exception/NN safe/JJ code/NN ./.
Normal/JJ failure/NN vs./IN bug/NN
How/WRB can/MD a/DT programmer/NN guarantee/NN that/IN a/DT nofail/C function/NN will/MD always/RB succeed/VB ?/.
After/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT function/NN could/MD have/VB a/DT bug/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ true/JJ ./.
The/DT exception/NN guarantees/NNS are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB offered/VBN by/IN bug-free/JJ code/NN ./.
But/CC then/RB ,/, in/IN any/DT language/NN ,/, calling/VBG a/DT function/NN supposes/VBZ the/DT function/NN is/VBZ bug-free/JJ ./.
No/DT sane/JJ code/NN protects/VBZ itself/PRP against/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN it/PRP having/VBG a/DT bug/NN ./.
Write/VB code/VB the/DT best/JJS you/PRP can/MD ,/, and/CC then/RB ,/, offer/VBP the/DT guarantee/NN with/IN the/DT supposition/NN it/PRP is/VBZ bug/NN free/JJ ./.
And/CC if/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT bug/NN ,/, correct/VB it/PRP ./.
Exceptions/NNS are/VBP for/IN exceptional/JJ processing/NN failure/NN ,/, not/RB for/IN code/NN bugs/NNS ./.
Last/JJ words/NNS
Now/RB ,/, the/DT question/NN is/VBZ "/`` Is/VBZ this/DT worth/JJ it/PRP ?/. "/'' ./.
Of/IN course/NN it/PRP is/VBZ ./.
Having/VBG a/DT "/`` nothrow/nofail/C "/'' function/NN knowing/VBG that/IN the/DT function/NN wo/MD n't/RB fail/VB is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ boon/NN ./.
The/DT same/JJ can/MD be/VB said/VBN for/IN a/DT "/`` strong/C "/'' function/NN ,/, which/WDT enables/VBZ you/PRP to/TO write/VB code/NN with/IN transactional/JJ semantics/NNS ,/, like/IN databases/NNS ,/, with/IN commit/NN //CC rollback/NN features/NNS ,/, the/DT commit/NN being/VBG normal/JJ execution/NN of/IN the/DT code/NN ,/, throwing/VBG exceptions/NNS being/VBG the/DT rollback/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, the/DT "/`` basic/C "/'' is/VBZ the/DT very/RB least/JJS guarantee/NN you/PRP should/MD offer/VB ./.
C++/NNP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB strong/JJ language/NN there/RB ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ scopes/NNS ,/, enabling/VBG you/PRP to/TO avoid/VB any/DT resource/NN leaks/NNS (/-LRB- something/NN a/DT garbage/NN collector/NN would/MD find/VB it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO offer/VB for/IN database/NN ,/, connection/NN or/CC file/NN handles/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
So/RB ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP see/VBP it/PRP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ worth/JJ it/PRP ./.

[/-LRB- nobar/USR ]/-RRB- This/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ recommendation/NN for/IN custom-written/JJ swap/C (/C )/C functions/NNS ./.
It/PRP should/MD be/VB noted/VBN ,/, however/RB ,/, that/DT std/C ::/C swap/C (/C )/C can/MD fail/VB based/VBN on/IN the/DT operations/NNS that/IN it/PRP uses/VBZ internally/RB the/DT default/NN std/C ::/C swap/C will/MD make/VB copies/NNS and/CC assignments/NNS ,/, which/WDT ,/, for/IN some/DT objects/NNS ,/, can/MD throw/VB ./.
Thus/RB ,/, the/DT default/JJ swap/NN could/MD throw/VB ,/, either/RB used/VBN for/IN your/PRP$ classes/NNS ,/, or/CC even/RB for/IN STL/NNP classes/NNS ./.
As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT C++/NNP standard/NN is/VBZ concerned/VBN ,/, the/DT swap/NN operation/NN for/IN vector/NN ,/, deque/NN ,/, and/CC list/NN wo/MD n't/RB throw/VB ,/, whereas/IN it/PRP could/MD for/IN map/NN if/IN the/DT comparison/NN functor/NN can/MD throw/VB on/IN copy/NN construction/NN (/-LRB- See/VB The/DT C++/NNP Programming/NN Language/NN ,/, Special/JJ Edition/NN ,/, appendix/NN E/NN ,/, E./NN 4.3./CD Swap/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Looking/VBG at/IN Visual/NNP C++/NNP 2008/CD implementation/NN of/IN the/DT vector/NN 's/POS swap/NN ,/, the/DT vector/NN 's/POS swap/NN wo/MD n't/RB throw/VB if/IN the/DT two/CD vectors/NNS have/VBP the/DT same/JJ allocator/NN (/-LRB- i.e./FW ,/, the/DT normal/JJ case/NN )/-RRB- ,/, but/CC will/MD make/VB copies/NNS if/IN they/PRP have/VBP different/JJ allocators/NNS ./.
And/CC thus/RB ,/, I/PRP assume/VBP it/PRP could/MD throw/VB in/IN this/DT last/JJ case/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, the/DT original/JJ text/NN still/RB holds/VBZ :/: Do/VBP n't/RB even/RB write/VB a/DT throwing/VBG swap/NN ,/, but/CC nobar/USR 's/POS comment/NN must/MD be/VB remembered/VBN :/: Be/VB sure/JJ the/DT objects/NNS you/PRP 're/VBP swapping/VBG have/VBP a/DT non-throwing/JJ swap/NN ./.

Details/NNS
It/PRP may/MD be/VB obvious/JJ to/TO many/JJ that/IN arguments/NNS to/TO functions/NNS have/VBP an/DT unspecified/JJ order/NN of/IN evaluation/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ probably/RB not/RB as/IN obvious/JJ how/WRB this/DT behavior/NN interacts/VBZ with/IN chained/VBN functions/NNS calls/NNS ./.
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB obvious/JJ to/TO me/PRP when/WRB I/PRP first/RB analyzed/VBD this/DT case/NN and/CC apparently/RB not/RB to/TO all/PDT the/DT expert/JJ reviewers/NNS either/RB ./.
At/IN first/JJ glance/NN it/PRP may/MD appear/VB that/IN since/IN each/DT replace/VBP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB evaluated/VBN from/IN left/NN to/TO right/NN that/IN the/DT corresponding/JJ function/NN argument/NN groups/NNS must/MD be/VB evaluated/VBN as/IN groups/NNS from/IN left/VBN to/TO right/RB as/RB well/RB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ incorrect/JJ ,/, function/NN arguments/NNS have/VBP an/DT unspecified/JJ order/NN of/IN evaluation/NN ,/, although/IN chaining/VBG function/NN calls/NNS does/VBZ introduce/VB a/DT left/NN to/TO right/JJ evaluation/NN order/NN for/IN each/DT function/NN call/NN ,/, the/DT arguments/NNS of/IN each/DT function/NN call/NN are/VBP only/RB sequenced/VBN before/RB with/IN respect/NN to/TO the/DT member/NN function/NN call/VBP they/PRP are/VBP part/NN of/IN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ this/DT impacts/VBZ the/DT following/JJ calls/NNS :/: s.find/C (/C "even"/C )/C and/CC :/: s.find/C (/C "don't"/C )/C which/WDT are/VBP indeterminately/RB sequenced/VBN with/IN respect/NN to/TO :/: s/C ./C replace/C (/C 0/C ,/C 4/C ,/C ""/C )/C
the/DT two/CD find/C calls/NNS could/MD be/VB evaluated/VBN before/IN or/CC after/IN the/DT replace/C ,/, which/WDT matters/VBZ since/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT side/JJ effect/NN on/IN s/C in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT would/MD alter/VB the/DT result/NN of/IN find/C ,/, it/PRP changes/VBZ the/DT length/NN of/IN s/C ./.
So/RB depending/VBG on/IN when/WRB that/WDT replace/C is/VBZ evaluated/VBN relative/JJ to/TO the/DT two/CD find/C calls/NNS the/DT result/NN will/MD differ/VB ./.
If/IN we/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT chaining/VBG expression/NN and/CC examine/VB the/DT evaluation/NN order/NN of/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT sub-expressions/NNS :/.

It/PRP is/VBZ going/VBG into/IN the/DT IF/C statement/NN even/RB if/IN the/DT edittext/C are/VBP empty/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO skip/VB to/TO the/DT else/C and/CC log/VB that/WDT not/RB all/DT fields/NNS are/VBP completed/VBN ./.
I/PRP have/VBP checked/VBN EVERYTHING/NN (/-LRB- that/IN I/PRP know/VBP as/IN a/DT noob/NN obviously/RB )/-RRB- ./.
