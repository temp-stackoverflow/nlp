This/DT is/VBZ called/VBN a/DT Regular/JJ Expression/NN Denial/NN of/IN Service/NN attack/NN and/CC it/PRP can/MD bring/VB a/DT website/NN to/TO its/PRP$ knees/NNS ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP aware/JJ of/IN that/DT ./.

Regex/C can/MD be/VB done/VBN safely/RB with/IN out/RP that/IN ./.
You/PRP just/RB need/VBP to/TO write/VB it/PRP in/IN a/DT safe/JJ way/NN ./.
No/UH its/PRP$ not/RB specific/JJ to/TO .NET/VB regex/NN ./.
Try/VB adding/VBG a/DT "/`` z/C "/'' to/TO the/DT end/NN of/IN your/PRP$ string/NN of/IN numbers/NNS ./.
Only/RB languages/NNS that/WDT use/VBP an/DT NFA/NN regex/NN engine/NN are/VBP vulnerable/JJ ./.
The/DT simple/JJ alternative/NN to/TO this/DT problem/NN could/MD be/VB solved/VBN by/IN granting/VBG appropriate/JJ permissions/NNS in/IN the/DT database/NN itself/PRP ./.
For/IN example/NN :/: if/IN you/PRP are/VBP using/VBG mysql/NNP database/NN ./.

GRANT/C SELECT/C ,/C INSERT/C ,/C DELETE/C ON/C database/C TO/C username@'localhost'/C IDENTIFIED/C BY/C 'password'/C ;/C

The/DT second/JJ thing/NN to/TO do/VB is/VBZ to/TO flush/VB the/DT privileges/NNS so/IN that/IN the/DT mysql/NNP refreshes/VBZ the/DT permissions/NNS and/CC updates/NNS ./.

Since/IN 0/CD is/VBZ exactly/RB representable/JJ as/IN an/DT IEEE754/NNP floating-point/JJ number/NN (/-LRB- or/CC using/VBG any/DT other/JJ implementation/NN of/IN f-p/JJ numbers/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB worked/VBN with/IN )/-RRB- comparison/NN with/IN 0/CD is/VBZ probably/RB safe/JJ ./.
You/PRP might/MD get/VB bitten/VBN ,/, however/RB ,/, if/IN your/PRP$ program/NN computes/VBZ a/DT value/NN (/-LRB- such/JJ as/IN theView/C ./C frame/C ./C origin/C ./C x/C )/C which/WDT you/PRP have/VBP reason/NN to/TO believe/VB ought/JJ to/TO be/VB 0/CD but/CC which/WDT your/PRP$ computation/NN can/MD not/RB guarantee/VB to/TO be/VB 0/CD ./.
To/TO clarify/VB a/DT little/NN ,/, a/DT computation/NN such/JJ as/IN :/: areal/JC =/JC 0.0/CD will/MD (/-LRB- unless/IN your/PRP$ language/NN or/CC system/NN is/VBZ broken/VBN )/-RRB- create/VBP a/DT value/NN such/JJ that/IN (/-LRB- areal/JC ==/JC 0.0/JC )/JC returns/VBZ true/JJ but/CC another/DT computation/NN such/JJ as/IN areal/JJ =/SYM 1.386/CD -/SYM 2.1/CD */SYM (/-LRB- 0.66/CD )/-RRB- may/MD not/RB ./.
If/IN you/PRP can/MD assure/VB yourself/PRP that/IN your/PRP$ computations/NNS produce/VBP values/NNS which/WDT are/VBP 0/CD (/-LRB- and/CC not/RB just/RB that/IN they/PRP produce/VBP values/NNS which/WDT ought/VBP to/TO be/VB 0/CD )/-RRB- then/RB you/PRP can/MD go/VB ahead/RB and/CC compare/VB f-p/JJ values/NNS with/IN 0/CD ./.
If/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB assure/VB yourself/PRP to/TO the/DT required/VBN degree/NN ,/, best/JJS stick/VBP to/TO the/DT usual/JJ approach/NN of/IN '/`` toleranced/JJ equality/NN '/'' ./.
In/IN the/DT worst/JJS cases/NNS the/DT careless/JJ comparison/NN of/IN f-p/JJ values/NNS can/MD be/VB extremely/RB dangerous/JJ :/: think/VB avionics/NNS ,/, weapons-guidance/NN ,/, power-plant/JJ operations/NNS ,/, vehicle/NN navigation/NN ,/, almost/RB any/DT application/NN in/IN which/WDT computation/NN meets/VBZ the/DT real/JJ world/NN ./.
For/IN Angry/NNP Birds/NNP ,/, not/RB so/RB dangerous/JJ ./.
Still/RB getting/VBG rep/NN from/IN this/DT one/CD ,/, so/IN I/PRP changed/VBD the/DT second/JJ example/NN snippet/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP are/VBP attacking/VBG it/PRP from/IN the/DT wrong/JJ angle/NN by/IN trying/VBG to/TO encode/VB all/DT posted/VBN data/NNS ./.
Note/VB that/IN a/DT "/`` </C "/'' could/MD also/RB come/VB from/IN other/JJ outside/IN sources/NNS ,/, like/IN a/DT database/NN field/NN ,/, a/DT configuration/NN ,/, a/DT file/NN ,/, a/DT feed/NN and/CC so/RB on/RB ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, "/`` </C "/'' is/VBZ not/RB inherently/RB dangerous/JJ ,/, its/PRP$ only/RB dangerous/JJ in/IN a/DT specific/JJ context/NN :/: when/WRB writing/VBG unencoded/JJ strings/NNS to/TO HTML/NNP output/NN (/-LRB- because/IN of/IN XSS/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN other/JJ contexts/NNS different/JJ substrings/NNS are/VBP dangerous/JJ ,/, e.g./FW if/IN you/PRP write/VBP an/DT user-provided/JJ URL/NN into/IN a/DT link/NN ,/, the/DT substring/NN "/`` javascript/NN :/: "/`` may/MD be/VB dangerous/JJ ./.
The/DT single/JJ quote/NN character/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VBZ dangerous/JJ when/WRB interpolating/VBG strings/NNS in/IN SQL/NNP queries/NNS ,/, but/CC perfectly/RB safe/JJ if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT part/NN of/IN a/DT name/NN submitted/VBN from/IN a/DT form/NN or/CC read/VBN from/IN a/DT database/NN field/NN ./.
The/DT bottom/NN line/NN is/VBZ :/: you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB filter/VB random/JJ input/NN for/IN dangerous/JJ characters/NNS ,/, because/IN any/DT charater/NN may/MD be/VB dangerous/JJ under/IN the/DT right/JJ circumstances/NNS ./.
You/PRP should/MD encode/VB at/IN the/DT point/NN where/WRB some/DT specific/JJ characters/NNS may/MD become/VB dangerous/JJ because/IN they/PRP cross/VBP into/IN a/DT different/JJ sublanguage/NN where/WRB they/PRP have/VBP special/JJ meaning/NN ./.
When/WRB you/PRP write/VBP a/DT string/NN to/TO HTML/NNP ,/, you/PRP should/MD encode/VB characters/NNS that/WDT have/VBP special/JJ meaning/NN in/IN HTML/NNP ,/, using/VBG Server/NN ./. HtmlEncode/JC ./.
If/IN you/PRP pass/VBP a/DT string/NN to/TO a/DT dyamic/JJ SQL/NNP statement/NN ,/, you/PRP should/MD encode/VB different/JJ characters/NNS (/-LRB- or/CC better/JJR ,/, let/VB the/DT framework/NN do/VBP it/PRP for/IN you/PRP by/IN using/VBG prepared/JJ statements/NNS or/CC the/DT like/JJ )/-RRB- ./.
When/WRB you/PRP are/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP HTML-encode/VBP everywhere/RB you/PRP pass/VBP strings/NNS to/TO HTML/NNP ,/, then/RB set/VB validateRequest/C =/C "false"/C ./.
In/IN .NET/SYM 4/CD you/PRP may/MD need/VB to/TO do/VB a/DT little/RB more/RBR ./.

Note/VB that/IN this/DT measure/NN is/VBZ only/RB meant/VBN to/TO thwart/VB this/DT very/RB specific/JJ type/NN of/IN attack/NN ./.

Assumptions/NNS about/IN the/DT attack/NN scenario/NN If/IN an/DT attacker/NN is/VBZ targeting/VBG variable/NN usernames/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ username/NN throttling/NN does/VBZ n't/RB fire/VB ./.
If/IN the/DT attacker/NN is/VBZ using/VBG a/DT botnet/NN or/CC has/VBZ access/NN to/TO a/DT large/JJ IP/NNP range/NN ,/, our/PRP$ IP/NNP throttling/VBG is/VBZ powerless/JJ ./.
If/IN the/DT attacker/NN has/VBZ pre-scraped/JJ our/PRP$ userlist/C (/-LRB- usually/RB possible/JJ on/IN open-registration/JJ web/NN services/NN )/-RRB- ,/, we/PRP ca/MD n't/RB detect/VB an/DT ongoing/JJ attack/NN based/VBN on/IN number/NN of/IN '/`` user/NN not/RB found/VBN '/`` errors/NNS ./.
And/CC if/IN we/PRP enforce/VBP a/DT restrictive/JJ system-wide/JJ (/-LRB- all/DT usernames/NNS ,/, all/DT IPs/NNS )/-RRB- throttling/NN ,/, any/DT such/JJ attack/NN will/MD DoS/NNP our/PRP$ entire/JJ site/NN for/IN the/DT duration/NN of/IN the/DT attack/NN plus/CC the/DT throttling/NN period/NN ./.
So/RB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB something/NN else/RB ./.
The/DT first/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT countermeasure/NN :/: Whitelisting/VBG
What/WP we/PRP can/MD be/VB fairly/RB sure/JJ of/IN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT attacker/NN is/VBZ not/RB able/JJ to/TO detect/VB and/CC dynamically/RB spoof/VB the/DT IP/NNP addresses/NNS of/IN several/JJ thousand/NN of/IN our/PRP$ users/NNS (/-LRB- +/SYM )/-RRB- ./.
Which/WDT makes/VBZ whitelisting/VBG feasible/JJ ./.
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS :/: for/IN each/DT user/NN ,/, we/PRP store/VBP a/DT list/NN of/IN the/DT (/-LRB- hashed/VBN )/-RRB- IPs/NNS from/IN where/WRB the/DT user/NN has/VBZ previously/RB (/-LRB- recently/RB )/-RRB- logged/VBN in/IN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, our/PRP$ whitelisting/NN scheme/NN will/MD function/NN as/IN a/DT locked/VBN '/`` front/JJ door/NN '/'' ,/, where/WRB a/DT user/NN must/MD be/VB connected/VBN from/IN one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ recognized/VBN '/`` good/JJ '/'' IPs/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO log/VB in/IN at/IN all/DT ./.
A/DT brute-force/JJ attack/NN on/IN this/DT '/`` front/JJ door/NN '/'' would/MD be/VB practically/RB impossible/JJ (/-LRB- +/SYM )/-RRB- ./.
(/-LRB- +/SYM )/-RRB- unless/IN the/DT attacker/NN '/`` owns/VBZ '/'' either/CC the/DT server/NN ,/, all/DT our/PRP$ users/NNS '/'' boxes/NNS ,/, or/CC the/DT connection/NN itself/PRP --/-- and/CC in/IN those/DT cases/NNS ,/, we/PRP no/DT longer/RB have/VB an/DT '/`` authentication/NN '/'' issue/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP a/DT genuine/JJ franchise-sized/JJ pull-the-plug/JJ FUBAR/NN situation/NN
The/DT second/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT countermeasure/NN :/: System-wide/JJ throttling/NN of/IN unrecognized/JJ IPs/NNS
In/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT whitelist/NN work/NN for/IN an/DT open-registration/JJ web/NN service/NN ,/, where/WRB users/NNS switch/VBP computers/NNS frequently/RB and/CC //SYM or/CC connect/VB from/IN dynamic/JJ IP/NNP addresses/NNS ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO keep/VB a/DT '/`` cat/NN door/NN '/'' open/NN for/IN users/NNS connecting/VBG from/IN unrecognized/JJ IPs/NNS ./.
The/DT trick/NN is/VBZ to/TO design/VB that/DT door/NN so/IN botnets/NNS get/VBP stuck/VBN ,/, and/CC so/RB legitimate/JJ users/NNS get/VBP bothered/VBN as/IN little/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ./.
In/IN my/PRP$ scheme/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ achieved/VBN by/IN setting/VBG a/DT very/RB restrictive/JJ maximum/NN number/NN of/IN failed/JJ login/NN attempts/NNS by/IN unapproved/JJ IPs/NNS over/IN ,/, say/VB ,/, a/DT 3-hour/JJ period/NN (/-LRB- it/PRP may/MD be/VB wiser/JJR to/TO use/VB a/DT shorter/JJR or/CC longer/JJR period/NN depending/VBG on/IN type/NN of/IN service/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC making/VBG that/IN restriction/NN global/JJ ,/, ie./URI for/IN all/DT user/NN accounts/NNS ./.
Even/RB a/DT slow/JJ (/-LRB- 1-2/CD minutes/NNS between/IN attempts/NNS )/-RRB- brute/JJ force/NN would/MD be/VB detected/VBN and/CC thwarted/VBN quickly/RB and/CC effectively/RB using/VBG this/DT method/NN ./.
Of/IN course/NN ,/, a/DT really/RB slow/JJ brute/JJ force/NN could/MD still/RB remain/VB unnoticed/JJ ,/, but/CC too/RB slow/JJ speeds/NNS defeat/VBP the/DT very/JJ purpose/NN of/IN the/DT brute/JJ force/NN attack/NN ./.
What/WP I/PRP am/VBP hoping/VBG to/TO accomplish/VB with/IN this/DT throttling/NN mechanism/NN is/VBZ that/IN if/IN the/DT maximum/NN limit/NN is/VBZ reached/VBN ,/, our/PRP$ '/`` cat/NN door/NN '/'' slams/VBZ closed/VBN for/IN a/DT while/C ,/, but/CC our/PRP$ front/JJ door/NN remains/VBZ open/JJ to/TO legitimate/JJ users/NNS connecting/VBG by/IN usual/JJ means/NNS :/.
Either/RB by/IN connecting/VBG from/IN one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ recognized/VBN IPs/NNS Or/CC by/IN using/VBG a/DT persistent/JJ login/NN cookie/NN (/-LRB- from/IN anywhere/RB )/-RRB-
The/DT only/JJ legitimate/JJ users/NNS who/WP would/MD be/VB affected/VBN during/IN an/DT attack/NN -/. ie./FW while/IN the/DT throttling/NN was/VBD activated/VBN -/: would/MD be/VB users/NNS without/IN persistent/JJ login/NN cookies/NNS who/WP were/VBD logging/VBG in/IN from/IN an/DT unknown/JJ location/NN or/CC with/IN a/DT dynamic/JJ IP/NNP ./.
Those/DT users/NNS would/MD be/VB unable/JJ to/TO login/VB until/IN the/DT throttling/NN wore/VBD off/RP (/-LRB- which/WDT could/MD potentially/RB take/VB a/DT while/NN ,/, if/IN the/DT attacker/NN kept/VBD his/PRP$ botnet/NN running/VBG despite/IN the/DT throttling/NN )/-RRB- ./.
To/TO allow/VB this/DT small/JJ subset/NN of/IN users/NNS to/TO squeeze/VB through/IN the/DT otherwise-sealed/JJ cat/NN door/NN ,/, even/RB while/IN bots/NNS were/VBD still/RB hammering/VBG away/RB at/IN it/PRP ,/, I/PRP would/MD employ/VB a/DT '/`` backup/JJ '/'' login/NN form/NN with/IN a/DT CAPTCHA/NN ./.
So/RB that/DT ,/, when/WRB you/PRP display/VBP the/DT "/`` Sorry/UH ,/, but/CC you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB login/VB from/IN this/DT IP/NNP address/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN "/'' message/NN ,/, include/VBP a/DT link/NN that/WDT says/VBZ "/`` secure/JJ backup/IN login/NN -/-- HUMANS/C ONLY/C (/C bots/NNS :/: no/DT lying/NN )/-RRB- "/'' ./.
Joke/NNP aside/NN ,/, when/WRB they/PRP click/VBP that/IN link/NN ,/, give/VB them/PRP a/DT reCAPTCHA-authenticated/VBN login/NN form/NN that/WDT bypasses/VBZ the/DT site-wide/JJ throttling/NN ./.

Ok/UH ,/, I/PRP see/VBP now/RB ./.
If/IN a/DT password/NN is/VBZ salted/VBN and/CC you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB the/DT salt/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO do/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN educated/VBN guessing/VBG to/TO figure/VB out/RP what/WP the/DT password/NN is/VBZ because/IN SHA1/NNP (/-LRB- stored/VBN salt/NN +/CC user/NN entered/VBD password/NN )/-RRB- ==/SYM stored/VBN hash/NN ./.

We/PRP see/VB ,/, then/RB ,/, that/IN prepared/JJ statements/NNS are/VBP enough/RB for/IN a/DT single/JJ query/NN ,/, but/CC by/IN themselves/PRP they/PRP are/VBP not/RB sufficient/JJ to/TO protect/VB against/IN sql/NNP injection/NN attacks/NNS throughout/IN an/DT entire/JJ application/NN ,/, because/IN they/PRP lack/VBP a/DT mechanism/NN to/TO enforce/VB that/IN all/DT access/NN to/TO a/DT database/NN within/IN the/DT application/NN uses/VBZ safe/JJ code/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP no/DT known/JJ primage/NN attacks/NNS on/IN MD5/NNP and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP collision/NN attacks/NNS does/VBZ not/RB make/VB pre-image/JJ attacks/NNS more/RBR or/CC less/RBR likely/JJ ./.

In/IN C/NNP //CC C++/NNP there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT function/NN called/VBD mysql_hex_string/C (/C )/C ,/, in/IN PHP/NNP you/PRP can/MD use/VB bin2hex/C (/C )/C ./.
Do/VBP n't/RB worry/VB about/IN that/IN the/DT escaped/VBN string/NN will/MD have/VB 2x/CD size/NN of/IN its/PRP$ original/JJ length/NN because/IN even/RB if/IN you/PRP use/VBP mysql_real_escape_string/C ,/, PHP/NNP has/VBZ to/TO allocate/VB same/JJ capacity/NN (/-LRB- (/-LRB- 2/CD */SYM input_length/CD )/-RRB- +/SYM 1/CD )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ ./.
This/DT hex/C method/NN is/VBZ often/RB used/VBN when/WRB you/PRP transfer/VBP binary/NN data/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP see/VBP no/DT reason/NN why/WRB not/RB use/VB it/PRP on/IN all/DT data/NNS to/TO prevent/VB SQL/NNP injection/NN attacks/NNS ./.
Note/VB that/IN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO prepend/VB data/NNS with/IN 0x/NNP or/CC use/VB the/DT MySQL/NNP function/NN UNHEX/C instead/RB ./.
So/RB for/IN example/NN the/DT query/NN :/: SELECT/C password/C FROM/C users/C WHERE/C name/C =/C 'root'/C Will/MD become/VB :/: SELECT/C password/C FROM/C users/C WHERE/C name/C =/C 0x726f6f74/C or/CC SELECT/C password/C FROM/C users/C WHERE/C name/C =/C UNHEX/C (/C '726f6f74'/C )/C
Hex/NN is/VBZ the/DT perfect/JJ escape/NN ./.
No/DT way/NN to/TO inject/VB ./.
Difference/NN between/IN UNHEX/C function/NN and/CC 0x/C prefix/NN
There/EX was/VBD some/DT discussion/NN in/IN comments/NNS ,/, so/IN I/PRP finally/RB want/VBP to/TO make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ ./.
These/DT two/CD approaches/NNS are/VBP very/RB similar/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP a/DT little/JJ different/JJ in/IN some/DT ways/NNS :/.
0x/C prefix/C can/MD only/RB be/VB used/VBN on/IN data/NNS columns/NNS such/JJ as/IN char/NN ,/, varchar/NN ,/, text/NN ,/, block/NN ,/, binary/NN ,/, etc/FW ./.
Also/RB its/PRP$ use/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ complicated/JJ if/IN you/PRP are/VBP about/IN to/TO insert/VB an/DT empty/JJ string/NN ./.
You/PRP 'll/MD have/VB to/TO entirely/RB replace/VB it/PRP with/IN '/`` '/'' ,/, or/CC you/PRP 'll/MD get/VB an/DT error/NN ./.
UNHEX/C (/C )/C works/VBZ on/IN any/DT column/NN ;/: you/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB to/TO worry/VB about/IN the/DT empty/JJ string/NN ./.
Hex/NN methods/NNS are/VBP often/RB used/VBN as/IN attacks/NNS
Note/VB that/IN this/DT hex/C method/NN is/VBZ often/RB used/VBN as/IN an/DT SQL/NNP injection/NN attack/NN where/WRB integers/NNS are/VBP just/RB like/IN strings/NNS and/CC escaped/VBN just/RB with/IN mysql_real_escape_string/C ./.
Then/RB you/PRP can/MD avoid/VB use/NN of/IN quotes/NNS ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP just/RB do/VBP something/NN like/IN this/DT :/: "/C SELECT/C title/C FROM/C article/C WHERE/C id/C =/C "/C ./C mysql_real_escape_string/C (/C $/C _GET/C [/C "id"/C ]/C )/C an/DT attack/NN can/MD inject/VB you/PRP very/RB easily/RB ./.
Consider/VB the/DT following/JJ injected/VBN code/NN returned/VBN from/IN your/PRP$ script/NN :/: SELECT/C .../F WHERE/C id/C =/C -/C 1/C union/C all/C select/C table_name/C from/C information_schema/C ./C tables/C
and/CC now/RB just/RB extract/VB table/NN structure/NN :/: SELECT/C .../F WHERE/C id/C =/C -/C 1/C union/C all/C select/C column_name/C from/IN information_schema/C ./C column/C where/C table_name/C =/C 0x61727469636c65/C
And/CC then/RB just/RB select/VB whatever/WDT data/NNS ones/NNS want/VBP ./.
Cool/NN is/VBZ n't/RB it/PRP ?/.
But/CC if/IN the/DT coder/NN of/IN injectable/JJ site/NN would/MD hex/VB it/PRP ,/, no/DT injection/NN would/MD be/VB possible/JJ because/IN the/DT query/NN would/MD look/VB like/IN this/DT :/.
SELECT/C .../F WHERE/C id/C =/C UNHEX/C (/C '2d312075...3635'/C )/C
@dadinck/USR If/IN it/PRP is/VBZ numeric/JJ ,/, you/PRP dont/MD need/VB to/TO hex/VB it/PRP ./.
@YourCommonSense/USR You/PRP are/VBP wrong/JJ !/.
Number/NNP 42/CD are/VBP two/CD bytes/NNS 4/CD and/CC 2/CD so/IN the/DT result/NN will/MD be/VB 0x3432/CD ./.
Also/RB be/VB aware/JJ of/IN using/VBG it/PRP like/IN that/DT because/IN if/IN id/NN does/VBZ nt/RB contain/VB anything/NN you/PRP will/MD get/VB id/C =/C 0x/C and/CC end/VB up/RP with/IN an/DT error/NN ./.

'/`` 42/CD '/'' in/IN hex/NN would/MD be/VB 0x3432/CD not/RB 0x42/CD

@YourCommonSense/USR you/PRP still/RB do/VBP nt/RB understand/VB ?/.
You/PRP can/MD not/RB use/VB 0x/NN and/CC concat/NN because/IN if/IN the/DT string/NN is/VBZ empty/JJ you/PRP will/MD end/VB with/IN an/DT error/NN ./.

@VivekKumarSrivastava/USR i/PRP do/VBP not/RB wanna/FW close/VB the/DT app/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB clean/VB the/DT form/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT user/NN still/RB in/IN the/DT Home/NNP activity/NN
@11684/USR :/: That/DT 's/VBZ because/IN he/PRP did/VBD n't/RB perform/VB adequate/JJ diagnostic/NN steps/NNS before/IN posting/VBG ,/, IMO/UH ./.
@RafaelT/USR &/CC Jave/NNP -/: While/IN it/PRP sounds/VBZ great/JJ ,/, this/DT actually/RB does/VBZ not/RB prevent/VB you/PRP from/IN clicking/VBG a/DT button/NN more/RBR than/IN once/RB ./.
If/IN you/PRP click/VBP rapidly/RB enough/RB you/PRP will/MD send/VB off/RP multiple/JJ clicks/NNS before/IN the/DT actual/JJ even/RB handler/NN is/VBZ called/VBN that/WDT disables/VBZ the/DT button/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ work/NN for/IN most/JJS cases/NNS since/IN most/JJS users/NNS are/VBP n't/RB going/VBG to/TO try/VB and/CC click/VB buttons/NNS like/IN crazy/JJ ../.
however/RB ,/, you/PRP will/MD always/RB have/VB that/DT one/CD guy/NN ..../.

I/PRP have/VBP a/DT feeling/NN you/PRP 're/VBP trying/VBG to/TO use/VB an/DT Activity/C where/WRB a/DT Dialog/NN would/MD suffice/VB ./.
Yeah/UH the/DT code/NN is/VBZ old/JJ ,/, long/UH ,/, and/CC crappy/JJ but/CC here/RB 's/POS what/WP it/PRP does/VBZ ./.
I/PRP have/VBP a/DT class/NN extending/VBG BroadcastReceiver/C that/WDT listens/VBZ for/IN KeyEvent/JC ./JC ACTION_DOWN/JC (/JC i.e./FW they/PRP pressed/VBD down/RP on/IN the/DT button/NN )/-RRB- ./.

The/DT service/NN does/VBZ clickCount/C ++/C (/C a/DT global/JJ )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC then/RB creates/VBZ a/DT RUNNABLE/C which/WDT does/VBZ this/DT :/: if/IN oldNumClicks/C ==/C clickCount/C ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP done/VBN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP the/DT #/SYM of/IN clicks/NNS ,/, else/RB return/NN ./.
THE/DT TRICK/NN is/VBZ to/TO call/VB handler/NN ./JC postDelayed/JC (/JC RUNNABLE/JC ,/JC delay_allowed_between_clicks/JC )/JC ./.

Copied/VB your/PRP$ code/NN to/TO a/DT project/NN of/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ and/CC there/EX is/VBZ no/DT semicolon/NN error/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP @BheshGurung/USR may/MD have/VB fixed/VBN it/PRP ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ n't/RB thrown/VBN a/DT error/NN yet/RB ./.
I/PRP ll/VBP send/VB a/DT beta/NN out/RP tonight/RB and/CC see/VB if/IN I/PRP can/MD get/VB others/NNS to/TO throw/VB the/DT error/NN ./.
@Toad/USR actually/RB yes/UH ,/, some/DT Unicode/JJ characters/NNS when/WRB stored/VBN as/IN UTF-16/NNP take/VB up/RP two/CD code/NN points/NNS ,/, i.e./FW 32/CD bits/NNS ./.

@JonathanGarcÃ­a/USR that/WDT just/RB means/VBZ the/DT object/NN is/VBZ an/DT array/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ valid/JJ JSON/NN AFAIK/NN ./.

Hi/UH I/PRP have/VBP a/DT address/NN book/NN app/NN ,/, I/PRP added/VBD a/DT "/`` favourite/JJ "/'' checkbox/NN to/TO it/PRP in/IN xml/NNP ./.

so/IN i/PRP want/VBP to/TO know/VB where/WRB to/TO write/VB setOnclickListner/JC event/NN ./.
I/PRP want/VBP to/TO open/VB another/DT activity/C on/IN click/NN button/NN ./.
I/PRP tried/VBD various/JJ combinations/NNS but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ gives/VBZ me/PRP error/NN every/DT time/NN ./.
my/PRP$ eclipse/NNP Version/NN :/: 8.1.2.201302132326/CD
please/RB tell/VB me/PRP where/WRB i/PRP can/MD write/VB code/NN ??????/.
after/IN adding/VBG setContentView/JC (/JC R/JC ./JC layout/JC ./JC activity_main/JC )/JC ;/JC it/PRP gives/VBZ an/DT Error/NN and/CC application/NN will/MD unfortunately/RB stooped/VB ./.
I/PRP also/RB remove/VB some/DT code/NN and/CC run/VB it/PRP but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB worked/VBD ./.
eg./FW
if/JC (/JC savedInstanceState/JC ==/JC null/JC )/JC {/JC getFragmentManager/JC (/JC )/JC ./JC beginTransaction/JC (/JC )/JC ./JC add/JC (/JC R/JC ./JC id/JC ./JC container/JC ,/JC new/JC PlaceholderFragment/JC (/JC )/JC )/JC ./JC commit/JC (/JC )/JC ;/JC }/JC
and/CC
public/JC static/JC class/JC PlaceholderFragment/JC extends/JC Fragment/JC {/JC public/JC PlaceholderFragment/JC (/JC )/JC {/JC }/JC @/JC Override/JC public/JC View/JC onCreateView/JC (/JC LayoutInflater/JC inflater/JC ,/JC ViewGroup/JC container/JC ,/JC Bundle/JC savedInstanceState/JC )/JC {/JC View/JC rootView/JC =/JC inflater/JC ./JC inflate/JC (/JC R/JC ./JC layout/JC ./JC fragment_main/JC ,/JC container/JC ,/JC false/JC )/JC ;/JC return/JC rootView/JC ;/JC }/JC }/JC
this/DT code/NN remove/VB from/IN coding/VBG but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB worked/VBD ./.
and/CC in/IN that/DT when/WRB i/PRP am/VBP creating/VBG new/JJ blank/NNP activity/NN then/RB there/EX is/VBZ fragment/NN activity.xml/URI will/MD created/VBN automatically/RB and/CC I/PRP want/VBP make/VB GUI/NN changes/NNS in/IN fragment/NN activity.xml/URI file/NN ./.
If/IN I/PRP made/VBD changes/NNS in/IN activity.xml/URI then/RB it/PRP gives/VBZ error/NN ./.
Please/RB help/VB me/PRP ./.
